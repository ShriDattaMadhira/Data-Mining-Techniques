    "Using the FP-Growth algorithm we have generated some rules that have confidence more than a set minimum confidence. These association rules describe that these items occur together. In other words, if I were to shop other vegetables and yogurt, then there is a 51.3% (conf = 0.513) chance of me also buying whole milk.\n",
    "These types of association rules are used by Amazon, eBay, and other ecommerce websites to suggest what people bought with the item you are currently buying.\n",
    "There are also other interesting uses. For example, IKEA uses this consumer data to build new stores' layout in a way that arranges the items with strong confidence in association rules near each other to instill the thought of buying in the customers.\n",
    "This has hugely increased the profits for the company and is now incorporated by every store around the world."
